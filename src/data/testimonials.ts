Easy to work with, speaking up when things could work better, while also being honest if a question is outside his skillset. However, he will also quickly learn, adapt, and figure things out. Besides having extremely strong and modern technical developer skills, he is also able to meet with business users directly to understand their requirements, see through the confusion or lack of details, and then create an efficient, well-designed, and scalable end-to-end solution which captures the heart of the business need.",

As a manager, Jeff is incredibly hands-on and personally invested. It is clear that we cares a great deal about the quality of work that goes into his projects, and is not afraid to jump in the trenches with the development team to get things done. As a developer, Jeff is highly-skilled and driven. In times that I was swamped with multiple projects, I knew that I could task Jeff with ANYTHING and know that it he would get it done in the required time-frame at a very high level of quality. Having excelled in both these roles makes Jeff a highly skilled developer WITH incredible soft skills. I would never say no to working with him in any capacity.",

His knowledge of social psychology makes him a very effective web developer, who understands his audiences and caters to their needs with compelling, creative and tasteful design. Jeff was a great partner and collaborator in all our marketing efforts, who came through with ideas and design that exceeded expectations on every occasion. His love and knowledge of sports took UWTV to new levels of design and marketing professionalism and engagement as we rolled out our first sports-related programming. Jeff is always focused on the user as he designs sites, making them simple and accessible for all audiences. Jeff was also organized, thorough, accountable and responsive in his relationship with me and other leaders at UWTV. He has since taken on a greater level of responsibility and has fulfilled all expectations. I would be thrilled to work with Jeff again and wish him the very best in his future career.",

His work in graphic design and in coding out sites using HTML/CSS was critical to the success of this group as he joined with a small group in serving a growing number of clients both inside and outside the college. His energetic and self-starter qualities separated Jeff from other workers I hired in my five years as Web group lead. He creatively tackled issues and effectively learned other technologies, such as flash, that helped raise the professionalism and user-centered nature of our sites and applications. I recommend Jeff for work in both the Graphic Design and Webmaster fields.",

                  I'm a seasoned Front-End Engineer and UI/UX Designer with over 15 years of
                  experience crafting scalable, user-centric web applications. I specialize in
                  transforming complex technical challenges into engaging, accessible, and visually
                  compelling digital experiences that drive real impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’ve led cross-functional teams and collaborated with international organizations,
                  startups, and academic institutions, helping them innovate, streamline workflows,
                  and deliver exceptional user experiences. Whether as an individual contributor or
                  team leader, I bring a deep understanding of software engineering, interaction
                  design, and UX best practices to every project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I thrive on the challenge of balancing technical rigor with creative design,
                  ensuring that every product is robust, efficient, and beautifully intuitive.

                  I’m passionate about crafting seamless digital experiences that are not just
                  functional but delightful to use. Whether I’m architecting a wizard UI for a
                  guided workflow, refining checklist-driven interactions, or optimizing a PWA for
                  mobile-first engagement, I approach every challenge with a user-first mindset and
                  a commitment to high-performance, scalable design.

# Enhancing Trust and Efficiency: A UX Case Study for Solar Channel Partners

At Solar Company, Inc., our channel partners — often brokers with deep community ties — are vital to driving growth. However, friction in our document submission and validation workflows created significant trust gaps and inefficiencies. 

This case study explores how we tackled these issues using iterative, user-centered UX design, resulting in a transformed experience that empowered our partners and accelerated our operations.

## The Challenge: Friction That Undermines Trust

Partners like **Rafa**, a former real estate agent turned solar broker, rely on our platform to manage deals and submit critical documents. But the experience was riddled with pain points:

* Frequent **document rejections** due to unclear requirements
* **Manual validation delays** and lack of immediate feedback
* Overwhelming, **non-intuitive interfaces**
* Communication gaps that **damaged client trust**
* No clear visibility into who owns each step of the process

The result? Delays, anxiety, and lost deals — for both our partners and our company.

## Meet Rafa: The Channel Partner Persona

Rafa is 35, a family man who recently transitioned from real estate to solar energy brokerage. He's:

* Tech-savvy, driven, and client-focused
* Motivated by trust, transparency, and financial stability
* Frustrated by unclear processes, delayed updates, and payment uncertainty

He embodies our typical channel partner and was central in shaping our UX decisions.

## Research & Discovery

Our UX team conducted:

* **Heuristic evaluations**
* **In-depth partner interviews**
* **Usability testing on our checklist and upload tools**
* **Analysis of assignment and document workflows**

### Key Findings:

* Cognitive overload from dense dashboards
* Ambiguity in document instructions led to ~3 rejections per lead
* Lack of clarity around task ownership
* Communication breakdowns during async steps
* Inability to track submission status or receive instant feedback

## Strategic UX Solutions

We focused on three core solutions and an iterative rollout approach:

### 1. Interactive Contextual Checklist

* Real-time validation for each checklist item
* "Help Needed?" tooltips offering clear document rules and submission examples
* Deep linking to each item step with state-saving
* Clear role indicators (who does what: partner vs. Solar Company)

**Outcome:** Fewer rejections, faster submissions, reduced partner frustration

### 2. Centralized Document Collection Portal

* Consolidated view of all pending documents
* Auto-validation for common errors (blurry uploads, mismatched addresses)
* Option for partners to delegate uploads to customers
* Compatible with both web and mobile

**Outcome:** Empowered partners and end-users, accelerated collection timelines

### 3. Async Upload Wizard with Progress Control

* Step-by-step wizard with visual progress indicators
* Support for skipping irrelevant steps via conditional logic
* Back/forward navigation with persistent input states
* Discrete URLs per step (deep-linkable for follow-ups)

**Outcome:** Simplified navigation for long processes, preserved context, reduced dropout

## Iterative Design: From Co-Mode to Standalone

### Short-Term Vision: Guided Mode vs. Power Mode

Partners could toggle between a simplified Guided Mode and the advanced Power Mode they were used to. This allowed us to test and iterate without disrupting familiar workflows.

### Long-Term Vision: Standalone Partner UI

* Sidebar navigation with real-time statuses
* Embedded FAQs and help options
* Integrated contact (e.g., WhatsApp support, dedicated phone number)
* Clean, intuitive, mobile-friendly experience

**Impact:** Reduced cognitive load, boosted confidence and partner trust

## Detailed UX Flow: Assignment Lifecycle

We redesigned the checklist item assignment experience to create a closed loop with full visibility:

1. Assigner creates assignment and optionally adds notes
2. Slack + in-app notifications alert the assignee
3. Assignee marks task complete
4. Assigner reviews and approves (or reassigns with feedback)
5. Checklist item status updates automatically

**Result:** Clear ownership, reduced miscommunication, smoother workflow

## Real-World Pain Points Solved

* **Before:** Partners uploading expired or blurry documents  
  **After:** Immediate feedback like "This CFE bill is over 120 days old"

* **Before:** Confusion over who owns which part of the process  
  **After:** Step owners clearly labeled as "Partner" or "Solar Company"

* **Before:** Rework due to mismatched names/addresses  
  **After:** Auto-checks with contextual tips before submission

* **Before:** Support only via Slack threads  
  **After:** Always-available support line + contextual help per checklist item

## Results & Outcomes

| Metric                               | Before | After   |
|--------------------------------------|--------|---------|
| Avg. document rejections per lead    | ~3     | <1      |
| Partner satisfaction (survey)        | 62%    | 91%     |
| Avg. time to complete upload flow    | 3.2 d  | 1.4 d   |
| % of leads dropped due to friction   | 27%    | 11%     |
| Support tickets about uploads        | High   | Low     |

## Conclusion

Through a deeply user-centered, iterative UX strategy, we:

* Empowered partners like Rafa to succeed
* Drastically reduced operational friction
* Rebuilt trust and transparency
* Positioned Solar Company, Inc. as a partner-focused market leader

This case study underscores how thoughtful UX — especially in B2B workflows — is not just about usability, but about sustaining relationships and unlocking growth.
